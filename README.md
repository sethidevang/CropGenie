# 🌾 CropGenie – An Agrology Powered Crop Predictor

Welcome to **CropGenie**, a WWDC Swift Student Challenge project that merges **agriculture** and **technology** into a field I proudly call **Agrology**. 🌱🚀

CropGenie is a Swift Playground app that empowers users—especially farmers and agricultural students—to predict the most suitable crop to grow based on specific soil and environmental conditions.

---

## 🔍 What Does CropGenie Do?

Given key input parameters such as:
- 🌡️ Temperature
- 💧 Humidity
- 🌧️ Rainfall
- 🌱 Nitrogen (N)
- 🧪 Phosphorus (P)
- 🔬 pH Level

**CropGenie** uses a trained machine learning model to recommend the best crop to grow in that environment.

## 🚀 Future Vision

- Expand to satellite-based data input (e.g., temperature/rainfall from real-time APIs)
- Incorporate farmer-specific data to improve ML accuracy
- Translate into local languages for rural access
- Introduce a mobile app for on-field predictions
